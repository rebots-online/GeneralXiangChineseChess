# Privacy Policy
*Last Updated: February 17, 2025*

## 1. Introduction
At Robin's AI World, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information when you use our services.

## 2. Information We Collect
- **Personal Information**: Name, email, payment details, and account information.
- **Usage Data**: IP address, browser type, device information, and interaction logs.
- **Cookies and Tracking**: We use cookies to enhance user experience and analyze website traffic.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
- To provide and improve our services.
- To process transactions and manage accounts.
- To communicate important updates and promotional content (you can opt-out anytime).
- To ensure security and prevent fraudulent activities.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
Your data is stored securely on servers located in Canada, where applicable; note that we heavily make use of Distributed Hash Table peer-to-peer technologies in our products and platforms for the benefits accrued to your personal/professional privacy and security. This means that where used on our platforms, such as for game state transport and intra-game, inter-personal communications, your data are not sent to any of our servers, but rather through encrypted peer-to-peer direct tunnels. 

Whilst functions like "Match me with players of my approximate skill level" do so through a global network of users of our platforms, meaning your connection may also, in return, help to locate and establish users of our platform not known to you, this is done completely transparently to you through secure tunnels. None of their data are available to you on your device, nor vice versa. These data are exchanged only where needed to assist in establishing connectivity without relying on a centralized server or database of IP addresses: neither Big nor Little Brother, on any of our servers, to watch or collect data on you when you're just trying to relax and enjoy a game!

We implement encryption and access controls to protect your data.

## 5. Sharing Your Information
- We do not sell your personal data.
- We may share data with third-party service providers for processing payments or analytics.
- We may disclose information if required by law.

## 6. Your Rights
- You can request access, correction, or deletion of your data.
- You can opt out of marketing communications.
- You can manage cookie preferences in your browser settings.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted on our website with an updated effective date.
