# Refund Policy
*Last Updated: February 17, 2025*

## Irrevocability of Transactions
All transactions executed through Robin's AI World are considered final, non-reversible, and non-negotiable. We do not offer refunds, reversals, exchanges, or cancellations for any digital product, software license, service subscription, or other intangible asset obtained through our platform. By proceeding with any financial transaction, the user explicitly acknowledges and consents to the binding nature of this policy and waives any future claims for reimbursement beyond the narrowly defined exceptions outlined below.

Users are responsible for carefully reviewing all transaction details before completing a purchase. We do not accommodate post-transaction disputes arising from user oversight, misinterpretation, or buyer's remorse. By engaging with Robin's AI World, users accept that all digital goods and services are provided on a non-returnable basis due to their intangible nature.

## Exceptional Considerations
While our refund policy is definitive, exceptions may be granted under strictly limited circumstances, solely at our discretion. These exceptions include, but are not limited to:
- Documented instances of duplicate charges resulting from a verifiable technical malfunction of our payment processing system, not caused by user error.
- Non-receipt of a purchased digital product or service due to a demonstrable failure within our infrastructure, excluding user-related technical issues, misconfigurations, or device incompatibilities.
- Billing discrepancies that are formally substantiated and acknowledged by Robin's AI World's financial oversight team, including erroneous charges applied to a user account.

To be considered for an exception, users must submit a formal written request within seven (7) calendar days of the transaction, accompanied by all relevant supporting documentation. Requests submitted beyond this period or lacking sufficient evidence will not be reviewed. Refund determinations are made exclusively at our discretion, and our decision is final and non-contestable.

## Chargebacks, Payment Processor Liability, and Dispute Prohibition
Initiating a chargeback or external payment dispute in violation of this policy constitutes a breach of our platform's terms. Such actions may result in the immediate and permanent suspension of the associated user account, revocation of access to any active services, and forfeiture of purchased digital assets. Robin's AI World bears no responsibility for any funds that are held, delayed, frozen, or otherwise withheld by third-party payment processors, irrespective of the reason, legality, or justification.

Users should be aware that centralized payment processing entities, including but not limited to banks, credit card networks, and online payment gateways, may enforce arbitrary policies that impact fund accessibility. Robin's AI World neither controls nor assumes liability for the actions taken by these institutions. We strongly encourage users to consider self-sovereign payment options if they are concerned about potential account restrictions, transaction delays, or financial interference by monopolistic payment processors. Choosing decentralized, peer-to-peer, or non-custodial payment solutions may help mitigate risks associated with centralized financial control.

If a user initiates a chargeback through their financial institution, they acknowledge that such an action directly contravenes the explicit agreement made at the time of purchase. Fraudulent chargebacks, defined as knowingly disputing a legitimate transaction, may result in legal recourse, collection efforts, or permanent restrictions on future access to Robin's AI World services. To avoid unnecessary escalation, users are strongly encouraged to contact our support team before engaging in dispute proceedings with their payment provider.

## No Recourse for Voluntary Account Termination or Service Withdrawal
Users who voluntarily terminate their account, discontinue the use of services, or fail to access purchased digital goods are not entitled to a refund under any circumstances. Robin's AI World does not provide compensation for unused portions of service subscriptions, expired access licenses, or situations in which a user elects not to utilize a purchased service or product.

Additionally, users acknowledge that certain services may have expiration dates, limited-time access, or ongoing subscription requirements. It is the sole responsibility of the user to remain aware of any usage limitations and ensure continued service access where applicable.
