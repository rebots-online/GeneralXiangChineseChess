## Implementation Notes

- The AI opponent uses classic minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- All processing happens client-side after initial load
- No external API dependencies required
- Designed for progressive enhancement (start simple, improve over time)
- Focus on balance between performance and play strength
- Implementation follows classic chess engine architecture adapted for Xiangqi
- Should work offline once loaded

## Future Enhancements (Post-Initial Release)

- Advanced evaluation incorporating piece synergies
- Opening book for common Xiangqi openings
- Endgame tablebase for perfect play in simple positions
- Learning capability to adapt to individual players
- Additional personality traits and play styles
- Hardware acceleration for deeper search on capable devices
