# General Xiang: Production Build Plan
*Date: Wednesday, May 1, 2025 - 10:15*

This document outlines the detailed plan to prepare the General Xiang Chinese Chess application for production deployment. The focus is on completing all necessary tasks to create a stable, optimized production build.

## 1. Performance Optimization

### 1.1 Component Rendering Optimization
- Implement React.memo for pure components
- Add useMemo and useCallback hooks for expensive calculations and callbacks
- Optimize re-renders by refactoring state management
- Use React DevTools to identify and fix performance bottlenecks

### 1.2 Code Splitting Implementation
- Configure dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Set up route-based code splitting with Next.js
- Implement React.lazy for component-level code splitting
- Create separate chunks for large dependencies

### 1.3 Lazy Loading for Non-Critical Components
- Implement lazy loading for tutorial components
- Add lazy loading for multiplayer functionality
- Set up intersection observer for below-the-fold content
- Implement progressive loading for game assets

### 1.4 Asset Loading Optimization
- Optimize image assets with next/image
- Implement proper loading strategies for sound files
- Add preloading for critical assets
- Implement responsive image loading based on device

### 1.5 Caching Strategies
- Configure browser caching headers
- Implement service worker for asset caching
- Set up local storage for game state persistence
- Add IndexedDB for larger data storage needs

## 2. Testing Implementation

### 2.1 Unit Tests for Game Logic
- Set up Jest testing framework
- Create tests for piece movement rules
- Add tests for game state management
- Implement tests for check and checkmate detection

### 2.2 Integration Tests for UI Components
- Set up React Testing Library
- Create tests for board rendering
- Add tests for user interactions
- Implement tests for theme switching

### 2.3 End-to-End Tests
- Set up Cypress for E2E testing
- Create tests for complete game flow
- Add tests for tutorial system
- Implement tests for multiplayer functionality

### 2.4 Cross-Browser and Device Testing
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Verify functionality on mobile devices
- Test on different screen sizes
- Verify touch interactions on mobile

## 3. Deployment Configuration

### 3.1 Environment Variables
- Create .env.production file
- Set up API keys for production
- Configure feature flags
- Add error reporting configuration

### 3.2 Build Optimization
- Configure Next.js build optimization
- Set up Terser for JavaScript minification
- Implement CSS optimization
- Configure proper tree shaking

### 3.3 Error Tracking and Monitoring
- Set up Sentry for error tracking
- Implement custom error boundaries
- Add logging for critical operations
- Create monitoring dashboard

### 3.4 Analytics Implementation
- Set up Google Analytics
- Add custom event tracking
- Implement conversion tracking
- Create performance monitoring

### 3.5 Deployment Pipeline
- Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Set up automated testing in pipeline
- Implement staging environment
- Create production deployment workflow

## 4. Documentation

### 4.1 User Documentation
- Create user guide
- Add FAQ section
- Implement in-app help
- Create tutorial videos

### 4.2 Developer Documentation
- Document code architecture
- Add API documentation
- Create contribution guidelines
- Document testing procedures
