## Current Architecture Considerations

The current architecture should be developed with these future requirements in mind:

1. **Component Design**
   - Use responsive design patterns
   - Implement touch-friendly UI elements
   - Design for various screen sizes and orientations

2. **State Management**
   - Ensure state can be persisted for offline use
   - Implement efficient data storage strategies
   - Design for synchronization when coming back online

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize bundle size
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize assets for mobile devices
   - Reduce battery consumption

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test on actual mobile devices
   - Implement device emulation testing
   - Create mobile-specific test cases

By considering these factors during the current development phase, we can ensure a smoother transition to PWA and Google Play Store deployment in the future.
