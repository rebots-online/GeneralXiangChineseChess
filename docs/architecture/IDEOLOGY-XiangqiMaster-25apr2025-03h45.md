# Xiangqi Master Ideology

## Core Philosophy

Xiangqi Master is built on the following core principles:

1. **Accessibility with Depth**: Make Chinese Chess accessible to beginners while providing depth for advanced players.
2. **Authentic Experience**: Preserve the traditional aspects of Xiangqi while enhancing them with modern technology.
3. **Community-Centered**: Foster a global community of Xiangqi players through peer-to-peer connectivity.
4. **Educational Focus**: Prioritize teaching and skill development at all levels of play.
5. **Privacy-First**: Use decentralized communication through Jami to ensure player privacy.

## Design Principles

### 1. Unified Player Interface

Both human and AI players implement the same interface, allowing seamless integration and consistent game logic regardless of player type.

### 2. Decentralized Architecture

The game uses a peer-to-peer model with Jami as the communication backbone, eliminating the need for centralized game servers and enhancing privacy.

### 3. Progressive Learning

The game is designed to grow with the player, from basic tutorials to advanced strategies, with AI opponents that adapt to the player's skill level.

### 4. Cultural Authenticity

While modernizing the interface, we maintain respect for the cultural heritage of Xiangqi, including traditional piece designs and terminology.

### 5. Transparent Monetization

Our tiered subscription model clearly communicates value at each level, with a free tier that provides genuine value and paid tiers that enhance the experience without creating unfair advantages.

## Technical Values

1. **Code Clarity**: Prioritize readable, well-documented code over clever optimizations.
2. **Modular Design**: Build components that can be tested and maintained independently.
3. **Resilient Communication**: Design for network instability with graceful fallbacks.

5. **Performance Efficiency**: Optimize for smooth gameplay on a wide range of devices.

## User Experience Goals

2. **Responsive Feedback**: Every action should provide immediate, clear feedback.
3. **Seamless Progression**: The journey from beginner to advanced player should feel natural and rewarding.
4. **Social Connection**: Enable meaningful interaction between players beyond just the game mechanics.
5. **Cultural Appreciation**: Foster understanding and appreciation of the cultural context of Xiangqi.
