## Notes on Jami's Store-and-Forward Capabilities

Jami uses a distributed hash table (DHT) for peer discovery, but has limited store-and-forward capabilities compared to traditional server-based systems. Here's how we'll address this:

1. **DHT Message Storage**: Jami can store small messages in the DHT for a limited time (typically 10 minutes), which allows for basic offline message delivery.

2. **Custom Store-and-Forward**: We'll implement our own store-and-forward mechanism on top of Jami:
   - Each peer will maintain a message queue for offline peers
   - Messages will be stored locally and retried when peers come online
   - We'll implement acknowledgment and delivery confirmation
   - Critical game state will be prioritized for delivery

3. **State Synchronization**: Our state synchronization system will:
   - Track which peers have received which state updates
   - Resend missed updates when peers reconnect
   - Use vector clocks to determine causality and ordering
   - Implement conflict resolution for concurrent updates

4. **Resilience Strategies**:
   - Designate backup hosts for game sessions
   - Implement state checkpointing for recovery
   - Use peer-to-peer mesh for redundancy
   - Implement graceful degradation for partial connectivity

These enhancements will provide robust communication even when peers disconnect suddenly, ensuring a seamless multiplayer experience.
