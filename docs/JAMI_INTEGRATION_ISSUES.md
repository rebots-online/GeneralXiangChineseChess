# Jami Integration Issues

## Current Status

The Jami-based game state multicaster for online multiplayer is currently not functioning correctly. The integration was previously marked as complete in the documentation, but testing reveals that it is not working as expected.

## Identified Issues

1. **Connection Establishment**
   - The application is unable to establish a connection with the Jami network
   - No error messages are displayed to the user when connection fails

2. **Game State Synchronization**
   - Game state changes are not being broadcast to other players
   - Received game state updates are not being applied correctly

3. **UI Integration**
   - The sidepanel buttons for load/save game functionality are not working
   - No visual feedback is provided for connection status

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network errors are not properly caught and handled
   - No fallback mechanism for offline play

## Technical Details

### Jami Integration Architecture

The application uses Jami as a peer-to-peer communication layer for multiplayer functionality:

1. **Game State Broadcasting**
   - When a player makes a move, the game state is serialized and broadcast to all connected peers
   - Each peer applies the received game state to their local board

2. **Player Matching**
   - Players can create or join game rooms using Jami IDs
   - Room discovery is handled through a distributed hash table

3. **Chat Functionality**
   - Text messages can be sent between players during a game
   - Chat history is stored locally

### Implementation Issues

The current implementation has several issues:

1. **API Compatibility**
   - The Jami JavaScript API may have changed since the initial implementation
   - Some method calls may be deprecated or have different signatures

2. **Authentication**
   - The authentication flow for Jami may not be completing correctly
   - Credentials may not be properly stored or retrieved

3. **Network Configuration**
   - Firewall or network settings may be blocking Jami connections
   - NAT traversal may not be working correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Diagnostic Testing**
   - Add logging to track Jami connection attempts
   - Create a simple test application to verify Jami connectivity

2. **Update Integration**
   - Update to the latest Jami JavaScript API
   - Implement proper error handling and user feedback

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Add connection status indicators
   - Provide clear error messages to users
   - Implement fallback for offline play

4. **Documentation**
   - Update integration documentation with current status
   - Document troubleshooting steps for common issues
