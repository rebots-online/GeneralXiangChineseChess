*Generated: April 30, 2025 16:00*

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the plan to implement a parallel Bitcoin payment system for General Zhang Chinese Chess as a post-initial release feature. This implementation will provide users with a decentralized payment option that aligns with our commitment to user sovereignty and privacy.

## Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Research & Planning | 2-3 weeks post-launch | Investigate Bitcoin payment processors, legal requirements, and technical architecture |
| MVP Implementation | 4-6 weeks | Develop minimal viable Bitcoin payment flow |
| Testing & Refinement | 2-3 weeks | Test payment flows, edge cases, and refine user experience |
| Public Release | 1 week | Deploy to production and announce to users |

- [ ] Plan for Lightning Network integration

### Additional Cryptocurrency Support
- [ ] Evaluate demand for additional cryptocurrency payment options
- [ ] Research integration requirements for other cryptocurrencies
- [ ] Prioritize based on user demand and implementation complexity

### Self-Custody Solutions
- [ ] Explore options for users to connect their own wallets
- [ ] Research Web3 wallet integration possibilities
- [ ] Consider self-custody subscription verification mechanisms

## Success Metrics

- Percentage of users opting for Bitcoin payments
- Transaction success rate
- Average confirmation time
- Customer satisfaction with Bitcoin payment option
- Revenue from Bitcoin payments
- Cost savings from reduced payment processing fees

## Principles

Throughout this implementation, we will adhere to these core principles:

1. **True Decentralization**: Minimize reliance on centralized payment processors where possible
2. **User Sovereignty**: Give users control over their payment methods and data
3. **Privacy**: Respect user privacy in all aspects of the payment flow
4. **Education**: Help users understand the benefits and mechanics of Bitcoin payments
5. **Transparency**: Be clear about transaction fees, confirmation times, and other aspects of Bitcoin payments
